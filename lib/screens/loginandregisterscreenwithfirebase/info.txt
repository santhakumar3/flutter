            15. after run the 14 th command in your terminal 

                    * then you need to select your firebase project name ( which you recently created project on firebase)
                      and don't select <create a  new project> option

            16. then terminal showing below question with you

                 Which platforms should your configuration support (use arrow keys & space to select)? 
                 android
                 ios
                 macOS
                 web

                 important : don't select anyone of this because we need to install the packages for all the platform ( android,ios,macOS,web)
                             
                Note : press enter button then all the packages will be installed

            17. this (16 th point) process very very important because flutter make it very easy to setup firebase automatically instead of manual setup like android firebase setup

            18. then open your firebase project and refresh the page.

            19. there you can see the four platforms( android, ios, macOS, web) firebase setup successfully completed on your project firebase account.

            20. then open below web link :

                * web link:  https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

                * then go to step 3 on the above web link

                *  then run below command on your project terminal

                    $ flutter pub add firebase_core

                *  then go to your project and open pubspec.yaml file there you can see "  firebase_core: ^2.20.0 " dependency added automatically.

                * then skip step 2 in the above link under Initialize Firebase in your app option

                * then add below link in your ( lib/main.dart ) file 

                    import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
                    import 'firebase_options.dart';

            21. then go to your project and open main.dart file 
                and then add below code into void main() function

                example : 

                    void main() async {

                        WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
                        await Firebase.initializeApp(
                            options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
                        );

                        runApp(const MyApp());

                    }

            22. then run the project using below command in your project terminal

                 $ flutter run

                 Note : if the app is run successfully then we can assume firebase setup completed successfully in the project

        

           Here after we are going to work on login setup using email and password from firebase Authentication  between login UI and firebase
           ====================================================================================================================================


           23. open your login_page.dart file and go to signUserIn() method while clic signIn button

           25. and then run below command in your project terminal

                $ flutter pub add firebase_auth
            
           26. and then open your pubspec.dart file and there you can see

                  option and then copy below code of this title

                  example :

                     try {
                        final credential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(

                        } else if (e.code == 'wrong-password') {
